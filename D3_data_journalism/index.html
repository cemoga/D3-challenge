          <h4>Highlights:</h4>
          <hr>
          <ul>It seems to be the case that the more poor households by state,
            the bigger the risk of obesity. But there are some exceptions like DC,
            where a high rate of poverty does not translate into a high rate of obesity.
            In fact, DC has the second-lowest rate of obesity in the country.
            This could lead us to consider additional factors that also affect obesity.</ul>
          <ul>From the plot, there is no clear relation between the age and the willingness to smoke. The data is spread
            all over the spectrum. Most of the smoking data is between the ages of 35 and 41. The state of West Virginia
            has the highest smoking rate (26.7%), where the average age is 41.9 years. Lousiana is a relatively young
            state where the average age is 36.1 years, but the smoking population accounts for 24%. </ul>
          <ul>A clear pattern can be established from the plot: the higher the household income the lower the rate of
            households with no health insurance. Texas is a big outliner with the highest rate of households with no
            health insurance (24.9%). The state's household-income-median ($53.035) is about the country's average.</ul>
